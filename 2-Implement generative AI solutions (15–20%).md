# AI-102: Implement generative AI solutions (15â€“20%)

## Build generative AI solutions with Azure AI Foundry
* Plan and prepare for a generative AI solution
* Deploy a hub, project, and necessary resources with Azure AI Foundry
* Deploy the appropriate generative AI model for your use case
* Implement a prompt flow solution
* Implement a RAG pattern by grounding a model in your data
* Evaluate models and flows
* Integrate your project into an application with Azure AI Foundry SDK
* Utilize prompt templates in your generative AI solution

## Use Azure OpenAI Service to generate content
